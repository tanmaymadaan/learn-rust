### Week 11: Project Focus & Advanced Topics Introduction

**Goal:** Apply learned concepts by starting a small project. Get a brief introduction to an advanced Rust topic for future exploration.

**Total Time:** ~3.5 - 5.5 hours (Weekdays: 5 _ 20-30 min, Weekend: 2 _ 60-90 min)

**Key Resources:**

- Your accumulated knowledge from Weeks 1-10!
- TRPL - Chapter 12 ("An I/O Project: Building a Command Line Program") - for project inspiration and structure.
- TRPL - Chapter 19.1 ("Unsafe Rust") OR Chapter 20 ("Final Project: Building a Multithreaded Web Server" - for async concepts if not using the Async Book directly) OR official "Async Book" (overview).
- Online resources for FFI if chosen.

**Day 71 (Weekday - 20-30 mins): Brainstorming & Scoping a Small Project**

- **Objective:** Choose a small, manageable project to apply your Rust skills.
- **Activities:**
  - Review: Skim the project ideas from the main plan (Week 11).
  - Ideas:
    - Simple CLI tool: e.g., a basic `grep` clone, a file renamer, a simple calculator, a task/todo manager.
    - Text-based game: e.g., number guessing game, very simple text adventure.
    - Basic utility: e.g., a tool to count lines of code in a directory.
  - Scope: Define the core features. Keep it small enough to be achievable in ~1.5 weeks. (20-30 mins)

**Day 72 (Weekday - 20-30 mins): Project Setup & Basic Structure**

- **Objective:** Set up the Cargo project and outline the basic module structure.
- **Activities:**
  - Action: `cargo new your_project_name`.
  - Plan: Think about the main functions and data structures. Create placeholder files/modules if needed. (20-30 mins)

**Day 73 (Weekday - 20-30 mins): Project Work - Core Logic Implementation**

- **Objective:** Start implementing the core functionality of your chosen project.
- **Activities:**
  - Focus on applying concepts like structs, enums, collections, error handling, control flow. (20-30 mins)

**Day 74 (Weekday - 20-30 mins): Project Work - Continued Implementation**

- **Objective:** Continue building out your project features.
- **Activities:**
  - Refer back to TRPL chapters or your notes for specific syntax or concepts. (20-30 mins)

**Day 75 (Weekday - 20-30 mins): Introduction to an Advanced Topic (Choose One)**

- **Objective:** Get a high-level overview of one advanced Rust area. This is for awareness, not mastery.
- **Choose ONE area for a brief exploration:**
  - **Unsafe Rust:**
    - Read: TRPL - Chapter 19.1 "Unsafe Rust" (focus on _what_ it is and _why_ it exists). (20-30 mins)
  - **Asynchronous Programming (Async/Await):**
    - Read: Overview section of the official "Async Book" ([https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/01_getting_started/01_chapter.html](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/01_getting_started/01_chapter.html)) or the async part of TRPL Chapter 20 (web server example). (20-30 mins)
  - **Foreign Function Interface (FFI):**
    - Read: TRPL - Chapter 19.2 "Advanced Lifetimes" (just kidding, skip this for FFI intro). Read Chapter 19.1 "Unsafe Rust" first, as FFI often involves unsafe. Then read "Calling Rust from Other Languages" or "Calling C code from Rust" from the Rust FFI Omnibus or official docs. (20-30 mins)

**Day 76 (Weekend - 60-90 mins): Project Work - Refinement & Adding Features**

- **Objective:** Continue developing your project, possibly adding a small new feature or refining existing code.
- **Activities:**
  - Write code, test, debug.
  - Consider adding basic tests for parts of your project. (60-90 mins)

**Day 77 (Weekend - 60-90 mins): Project Work & Advanced Topic Review**

- **Objective:** Make more progress on the project and briefly review the chosen advanced topic.
- **Activities:**
  - Project implementation. (45-60 mins)
  - Briefly re-read or review notes on the advanced topic from Day 75. What are the key takeaways? (15-30 mins)
